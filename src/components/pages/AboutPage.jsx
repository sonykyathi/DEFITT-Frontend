                <p className='white mb-2'>
                  DEFItt is built on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), a blockchain
                  network optimised for smart contract/based application
                  execution. BSC works in combination with Binance's native
                  Binance Chain (BC), providing users with the best of both
                  worlds: the large transaction potential of BC and the smart
                  contract features of Binance Smart Chain. This function allows
                  developers to quickly install or migrate DApps, tools, and
                  other ecosystem components on the BSC network. Binance Smart
                  Chain also supports the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).

                <p className='white mb-2'>
                  Decentralisation is the major advantage of the blockchain. The
                  autonomous transparent blockchain executes smart contracts
                  exactly as planned, with no manipulation, monitoring,
                  downtime, or external third/party interference. Another
                  significant advantage achieved by using blockchain is
                  transparency. Everyone has access to the blockchain since the
                  blocks are disseminated to every node on the grid. Since the
                  entire ecosystem is dispersed, hacking the system is extremely
                  difficult, resulting in excellent security.

                <h4>Global Market Overview</h4>
                <p className='white mb-2'>
                  In 2021, cryptocurrency has its finest year ever. While
                  virtual currencies were one of the few businesses to thrive in
                  2020, they are just getting more widespread, popular, and
                  accessible. Cryptocurrency is gaining popularity throughout
                  the world, with recent innovation in the United States and
                  elsewhere, and emerging economies leading the trends.
                  According to studies, blockchain technology is expected to
                  contribute significantly to global GDP by 2030. A
                  cryptocurrency is a type of digital or virtual currency that
                  is encrypted to track transactions and prevent counterfeiting.
                  It has no physical representation and is distributed via a
                  vast network of nodes connected to a virtual universe. It
                  operates on a decentralised network structure based on
                  blockchain technology. Transfers are encrypted using either
                  public or private keys and are directly linked to the user's
                  digital wallet. Unlike traditional currencies, it is not
                  distributed by a single company and is not vulnerable to
                  government intervention or manipulation. It also offers
                  several advantages, such as increased mobility,
                  transferability, inflation resilience, and visibility.
                  Furthermore, the regulation and acceptance of buying, selling,
                  or trading virtual currency in several developing countries is
                  propelling business expansion due to the high level of
                  accountability provided by distributed ledger technology or
                  blockchain. As a result, there is little chance of
                  illegitimate or unintended transactions as a result of human
                  or computer error or data manipulation. This enables both
                  parties to track any modifications made during the process in
                  real-time, including increased data protection and transaction
                  immutability. Additionally, quick access to online trading
                  platforms that can be accessed via smartphones is fuelling
                  business growth. The global crypto industry is drawing not
                  just retail buyers, but also conventional financial
                  institutions and large companies hoping to benefit from the
                  emerging trend in digital assets. As a result, we are seeing
                  the highest appreciation of cryptocurrencyâ€™s in history and it
                  is becoming a part of the industry that is here to stay.
